# JarGame
Project1 - Guess how many are in the jar

A game where the player can guess how many items are in the jar.
The administrator of the game is prompted to enter the type of item the jar is filled with and the maximum quantity of the
item that fits in the jar. A random number is then generated between 1 and the maximum quantity so that the player can guess.
The player is then told what type of item the jar is filled with and prompted to guess between 1 and the maximum quantity 
the administrator indicated. If the player guesses above the maximum quantity, the player is told that their guess must be 
below the maximum quantity and their guess is not counted against them. If their guess is below or above the random number, 
then a helpful hint is provided to let the player know that their guess was too low or too high. When the user guesses the
correct number, they are notified they have guess correctly and how many guesses it took.
